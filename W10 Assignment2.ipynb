    "Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency? \n",
    "\n",
    "A measure of central tendency (also referred to as measures of centre or central location) is a summary measure that attempts to describe a whole set of data with a single value that represents the middle or centre of its distribution.\n",
    "There are three main measures of central tendency:\n",
    "mode\n",
    "median\n",
    "mean\n",
    "Each of these measures describes a different indication of the typical or central value in the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the average where the sum of all the numbers is divided by the total number of numbers, whereas the median is the middle value in the list of given numbers numerically ordered from smallest to biggest and mode is the value of the number which occurs most often in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the average of given data values. The formula to calculate the mean value is:\n",
    "Mean = Sum of observation/Number of observations\n",
    "For example, Mean of 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 is, (2+5+6+7+8)/5 = 28/5 = 5.6\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a given observation. For example, 23, 33, 43, 63, and 53 is a set of observations; then, to find the median, we need to arrange the given values in an order (ascending or descending). Hence, we get\n",
    "23, 33, 43, 53, 63\n",
    "Therefore, Median = 43\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode represents the value which is repeated the maximum number of times in a given set of observations. For example, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, and 15 are the set of data. Here, the number 13 is repeated twice and is considered to be the mode value.\n",

Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that do not overlap do not share those traits.Venn diagrams help to visually represent the similarities and differences between two concepts.

Since the mid-20th century, Venn diagrams have been used as part of the introductory logic curriculum and in elementary-level educational plans around the world.\n",

    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data? \n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is a measurement of the distortion of symmetrical distribution or asymmetry in a data set. Skewness is demonstrated on a bell curve when data points are not distributed symmetrically to the left and right sides of the median on a bell curve. If the bell curve is shifted to the left or the right, it is said to be skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images.\n",
    "A distribution can have right (or positive), left (or negative), or zero skewness. A right-skewed distribution is longer on the right side of its peak, and a left-skewed distribution is longer on the left side of its peak:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "When the distribution is skewed to the right, the mean is often greater than the median.The mean is affected by outliers that do not influence the median.\n",

    "Correlation:\n",
    "Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates how strongly two variables are related.\n",
    "The value of covariance lies in the range of -∞1 and +∞\n",
    "Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables while correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation is a function of the covariance. What sets these two concepts apart is the fact that correlation values are standardized whereas covariance values are not. You can obtain the correlation coefficient of two variables by dividing the covariance of these variables by the product of the standard deviations of the same values. We’ll see what this means in practice below\n",

    "Normal distribution\n",
    "In a normal distribution, data is symmetrically distributed with no skew. Most values cluster around a central region, with values tapering off as they go further away from the center. The mean, mode and median are exactly the same in a normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Outliers are extreme, or atypical data value(s) that are notably different from the rest of the data.\n",
    "It is important to detect outliers within a distribution, because they can alter the results of the data analysis.  The mean is more sensitive to the existence of outliers than the median or mode.  \n",
    "Consider the initial retirement age dataset again, with one difference; the last observation of 60 years has been replaced with a retirement age of 81 years.  This value is much higher than the other values, and could be considered an outlier.  However, it has not changed the middle of the distribution, and therefore the median value is still 57 years.  \n",

    "In this distribution the outlier value has increased the mean value.  \n",
    "Despite the existence of outliers in a distribution, the mean can still be an appropriate measure of central tendency, especially if the rest of the data is normally distributed.  If the outlier is confirmed as a valid extreme value, it should not be removed from the dataset. Several common regression techniques can help reduce the influence of outliers on the mean value.\n",
